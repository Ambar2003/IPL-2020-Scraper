About

In this project I have scrapped all the batsmen's statisitcs of the matches of IPL 2020.

How it works?

Just open the main.js file in terminal and write command Node main.js
First it will show all links and then the batsmen's statistics
Simultaneously excel file for each batsman will be created in ipl folder
You can open and see each batsman's statisitics

Notable shortcomings
1. The program does not consider the out and not out batsman the same so it will create different excel files for their out and not out status respectively
2. There is no team name and opponent name section in the excel file
